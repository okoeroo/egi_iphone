Original README:


This is the iPhone app for the Hackers on Planet Earth conference for 2010. It's designed to display the HOPE schedule and make it easy to keep track of talks you want to attend.

Most of the logic happens in a UIWebView, so it's written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The rest is written in Objective-C with the iPhone SDK.

Data gets pulled from a server running this web application:
